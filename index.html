    <h1>Why AI Sucks</h1>
    <h2>by Chloe Becker and the clanker</h2>

    <p>Artificial Intelligence is powerful, but it's far from perfect. A lot of people think it's going to solve everything, but that's just not true.</p>

    <p>Here are some reasons why AI can be frustrating or even harmful:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>It makes mistakes â€” sometimes big ones.</li>
        <li>It can be biased, depending on how it's trained.</li>
        <li>It lacks common sense and basic understanding of the world.</li>
        <li>It can replace jobs, which affects real people.</li>
        <li>It can be used in ways that invade privacy.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In short, AI isn't magic. It's just a tool, and like any tool, it can be misused or fail completely.</p>
